# Task_Management_App (Taskin)

Hello All this is my second github project

This project is built with HTML,BOOTSTRAP AND JAVA SCRIPT

Its a Task Management Web application, where we can add, edit, search, and delete tasks which has title,image,type and description,And It stores data on browser,
It uses LocalStorage for storing data and tasks,
We can Save Links and Names from tasks and also displays in recently added tasks,
We search tasks based on the name or any in details entered in Task.

Thank You...
